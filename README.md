BLOOKET FIXED THE JOIN API SO IT ONLY GUESSES GAME PINS. (its super accurate though, only when a lot of games are being hosted).

# What is this?
This is what I __used__ to __use__ way before when I started joining peoples games. After that I made a nother program in JS and I used that cause it was 10 times better than a __brute forcer__.

# Why I made this open source?
Cause its super simple to make and doesn't take any effort and the bot won't join it justs finds the pins and stores them in codes.txt
